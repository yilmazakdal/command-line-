COMMAND LINE IN TERMINAL
pwd : print working directory (Shows you the path to the working directory.By typing this we’re asking the
computer which folder(directory) we are in.

ls : short form of list. It lists the folders and files inside my current working directory (pwd) If you wanna go into
one of these folders we type this:

cd ( change directory) and the name of the file.
Eg: cd Documents or cd Music

If you wanna go back one level before, you type: cd ..
• You can go through old commands by using up or down arrows

• Cmd k: This helps you look your terminal clean.You can still use arrows!because it doesn’t clean the history. Remember, you can also type the command 'clear'.
Ctr a: Gets you to the beginning of the cursor, Ctr e: to the end of the line. Click option and cursor where you
wanna go. Ctr u: it deletes the whole line

If you wanna delete the command you wrote because you may think you’ve made a typo.So in that case just ctr c
to kill the running.

• Mkdir:(make directory) it creates a folder.
Eg: mkdir “Northcoders course”. If you don’t use the quotation mark,it would create two folders named
Northcoders and course. Or another way to create the folder is:
Eg: mkdir Northcoders\ course. There is a backslash and a space before course.You can create more folders on
the same line.

• Touch: this command will create a file. Eg: touch term-paper.txt. To open that file use Open command.
Eg: Open term-paper.txt
To move a file into another folder use mv command. Eg: mv+file name+which folder to move by using absolute
path or relative path

Eg: mv biology-spreadsheet.csv ~/Desktop/Second\ semester/Biology (absolute path)
• cp command: eg: cp end-of-term-paper.csv ../Final\ papers1

• Also there is echo command.It allows you to paste a text inside a txt file.
Eg: echo “hello world, how are you today.How is life going?” > paper.txt. So pasted the text inside the quotation
mark and placed it into paper.txt. Before writing the name of the txt, we need to use > sign to direct it.
To see the content of txt, we use cat command
Eg: cat notes.txt

• grep : to find a content inside a text.
Eg: grep how paper.txt (We look for word how in paper.text But here that grep command will show the lines
which consists “how”. While coding grep will help you.
